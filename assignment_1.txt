1.Various sources of big data
     The various sources of big data are
          * Banking
          * Social network
          * Weather forecasting
          * Business Apps
          * Industrialized and Natural Resources
          * Transportation



2.3 V's of Big data
     The 3 V's of big data are
          *Volume:
                 The quantity of generated and stored data (ie) the amount of data.

          *Variety:
                 The type and nature of the data.It can be structured,unstructed or semi structed data.

          *Velocity:
                 The speed at which the data is generated and processed. 



3.Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
     
      * Horizontal Scaling:

             -It is also called as scale-out.
 
             -Horizontal scaling has the ability to increase the capacity by connecting
                   multiple software or hardware entities together in such a way that they function as a single logical unit.

      * Vertical Scaling:
 
             -It is also called as scale-up.

             -Vertical scaling is the process of adding physical resoures to the 
                   existing database in order to improve the performance.
                       
             -It helps in upgrading the capacity of the existing database server. 




4.Need and Working of Hadoop
    
       * Need of Hadoop:
                    
               -Hadoop is mostly needed to handle large volume of data efficiently 
                           (ie) it handles both the structured and unstructured data.
               
               -Hadoop is cost saving because it is a open source software and it can run on commodity hardware.
             
        * Working of Hadoop:
               
               - When user access either structured or unstructured data,the data is broken up into parts 
                         and the broken parts are loaded into file system.
                       
               -The file system is made up of multiple nodes.The parts that are saved in the file system
                               are replicated multiple times and they are safe from failure.
